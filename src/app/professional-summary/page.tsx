          A dedicated HR professional with 4+ years of experience, I have a deep
          understanding of talent acquisition, employee engagement, and policy
          development, along with exceptional interpersonal and multitasking
          skills. Alongside my HR expertise, I am passionate about web
          development and coding, actively pursuing skills in programming,
          including TypeScript and Next.js. By combining my HR experience with a
          strong technical foundation, I aim to bring innovative solutions to a
          forward-thinking organization, contributing to both HR strategy and
          technological growth.
