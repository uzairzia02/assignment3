          I hold a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) with a
          specialization in Human Resource Management and a Bachelor’s degree in
          Science. Driven by my passion for technology, I am currently pursuing
          an advanced course in Artificial Intelligence, Web 3.0, and Metaverse
          from GIAIC. Having successfully completed Quarter 1, where I mastered
          TypeScript, I am now diving into Next.js in Quarter 2, expanding my
          expertise in modern web development.
