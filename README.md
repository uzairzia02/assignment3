# assignment3

Your task for Assignment 3 is to continue working on the same codebase from the previous assignment. This time, you'll be adding a header and footer to the profile section page. In the header, include a few links that will route to the following pages:

Portfolio
About
Contact Us

These pages can be simple, dummy pages with just a title displayed for now. The focus of this assignment is on the layout and design.

Feel free to continue experimenting with colors, fonts, shadows, and any other design enhancements that improve the overall presentation of the page.
